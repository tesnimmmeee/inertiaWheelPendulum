# inertia_wheel_pendulum_labVIEW_ARDUINO

This is a project of designing and controlling the reaction wheel inverted pendulum based entirely on Arduino and labVIEW

I had the opportunity to work with 3 teammates : Rayen Bel Fayez, Nour Ben Romdhaneand Mahdi Nouni on a #LabVIEW project assigned by our professor in the National Institute of Applied Science and Technology in Tunisia.

The project is entitled "inertia wheel pendulum"  and is a well known benchmark in the field of controls . 
it consists of elaborating a system capable of stabilizing the pendulum on the inverted equilibrium point.
This principle is widely used in modern systems such as gymnastic robot .

The project involved  :

* making a mathematical model of the system
* hardware design with solidworks
* Fritzing and Proteus Modeling 
* communication design using VISA package for interfacing between arduino and labVEIW
* comparing defferent type of controlor : LQR VS PID 
* Developping a #PID controller and tuning its parameters


This project, was a good opportunity for us to apply the theory we've been learning throughout this academic year , I want to thank my teammates for their support and perseverance .
